     <p>Case â€“ A case is a piece of the computer build that is often overlooked but huge when buying the parts for your build. Not only must it look cool, but it must be able to store all the pieces of your computer. It must be able to fit the motherboard, power supply, and all your extra cards that you are planning to throw in there. Air circulation is also important to ensure that none of your pieces overheat. The proper number of fans and spots for those fans is an important aspect as well. You need to also have enough slots for your hard drives and USB ports to ensure you have a build that fits you.</p>
