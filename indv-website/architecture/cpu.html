     <p>CPU – The central processing unit of a computer can be thought of the brain of the computer. It is where all instructions of a program are processed. Processing can be either mathematical operations, like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division, or assigning values to certain spots in memory. The processor can’t handle all of information at once, so it uses Random Access Memory (or RAM) to store the values it needs later. Please refer to RAM in the “Learn” section of this website to learn more. Historically, all commands flowed thru the processor (another name for CPU) to receive answers to their instructions. Now, other pieces of hardware (like the graphics card) can also process instructions to help spread the work load of the computer. </p>
