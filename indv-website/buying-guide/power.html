        <p>Power is one of the more simpler topics to cover when trying to buy parts for your next build. Power Supplies say right on the box what connectors they have and how many watts they produce. All you have to do is check your motherboard and processor to see what they need. Then make sure all your cards and hard drives have power connectors and you should be good! Don't forget about fans too. You want to make sure that your computer is cool if you know what I mean..</p>
