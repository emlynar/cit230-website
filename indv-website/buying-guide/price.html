        <p>Now this is the guide that you all have been waiting for! The page that tells you all the ins and outs about the price of computer parts. Can it be said in one page though? The answer is no. All the information that you need to truly understand pricing of computer parts would go on and on. Generally speaking though, like any product, there are trends of prices going up as well as down. It is your job to spot these trends and shoot when the prices are low. I've heard, that it's always good to buy your laptops when there are back to school deals. School always comes and student will need their laptops. So wait to buy a laptop as a whole when the back to school deals are on. The same concept applies to PC parts. You have to know when the deals are gonna fire. You also need to be aware of pricing tools that are out there already. These tools can help chart the past prices of parts like the ever rare RAM or the newest processor out on the market. So, when looking for a piece based on price, make sure to do you due diligence and shop around.</p>
