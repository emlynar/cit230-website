        <p>Network Connections â€“ Another important piece to your build is your network connection. If you have a standard setup, your motherboard should have an ethernet port for you to plug in your ethernet cable. This cable plugs into your router and away you go! If your network is not as simple as that, you will have to contact your network administrator. If you did it yourself and you are the network administrator, then you will have to see where in your setup to plug in. Most of the time, you must find a way to the switch or router in your network. Sometimes you may have a wireless card or a peripheral that connects to the network with Wi-Fi. If your home or work network supports Wi-Fi, you should be good. Adapting to your network can either be simple or complicated; it just matters what your network is like. </p>
