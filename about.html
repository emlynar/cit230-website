  <p>My name is Eric Mlynar and I am from Michigan. I am a student at a collage in Idaho and I am studying Computer Information Technology. I am also an aspiring developer and IT professional. In my free time, I like to visit with friends, play video games, run, and enjoy life. Someday, I wish to earn enough to be able to start a charity. This charity is to be determined, but I have a few ideas.
