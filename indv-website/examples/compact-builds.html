        <p>Sometimes you need a build that can just fit where it needs to go. Some people make builds so small they can carry them in their hand! Like a raspberry pi. Others are just trying to fit in their furniture that they got or even transportable to a LAN party. It's up to you how you build it, but compact sometimes is the way to go!</p>
