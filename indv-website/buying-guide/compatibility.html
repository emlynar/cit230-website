        <p>Compatibility is a huge decision point when buying computer parts. If they aren't compatibile, they won't work. One example of compatibility is the type of motherboard and processor you have. Motherboards come in all shapes and sizes, but not all of them will suit your needs. Processors have a more narrow selection and require certain types of CPU sockets in the motherboard. So, when buying this piece of equipment, read thru the specs and make sure that you have a motherboard and processor that work together. This is not the only type of compatibility that you should worry about, but it's definitely a big subject. You may have RAM that may not work. It all depends! So, rule of thumb, make sure you do your research.</p>
