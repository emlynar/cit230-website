        <p>Finding assistance for building a computer maybe hard at sometimes. It's not exactly a talent that everyone has. So there are three paths you can take to help build your computer. First, you can go online. There are many websites dedicated to building computers from scratch and give you tutorials and tips on how to do so. Youtube is also a great place to start looking at guides for building. Our second route would be to find a local vendor. There are some small businesses out there that would love to help you pick your parts and build them, for a small fee of course. But it's more of a personal option if you're into that. The third way to build a computer is to network with your friends. Many of your friends and colleages may have the same interest as you and may know a thing or two about building a computer. Ask around and see what you can find. Any of these paths are viable options. Go ahead and find out what you can!</p>
