        <p>Storage is a subtle but key component to a computer setup. It is where all of your data is stored. Anything from pictures, movies, programs, or games could be on there. Out in the industry, there are three types of storage components. First is an HDD or a Hard disk. This is your traditional hard-drive or storage type. Second is the SSD or the solid state drive. These cost more per Gigabyte, but are much faster than your standard hard-drive. And third, there is an M.2 which is fastest of them all! It almost looks like a stick of memory but is used to store data. All of these types have their advantages and disadvantages, but all are useful.</p>
