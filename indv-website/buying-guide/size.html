        <p>This concept may be over rated, but knowing the size of your computer parts matters. You wouldn't want to buy the biggest, baddest graphics card out there to find out it doesn't fit in your case. So, when buying computer parts, make sure to keep in check the size of each of these pieces and where they will go in your case. Size can be broken down into 2 main parts, the case and the motherboard. Motherboards come in standard sizes, that can be smaller or larger. But these sizes are standard so you can depend on it being certain dimensions. From there, you can pick out a case that will hold the motherboard. But don't just pick those two and call it quits. Be sure to include an inventory of all your parts and see if they will fit in your build. Also, you may want to scale up or down your build by use case. For instance, you may want a computer for your studio apartment. You don't have the space for a server rack! So scale it down a bit to fit in whatever space you plan on having your PC. So remember, size <strong>does</strong> matter.</p>
