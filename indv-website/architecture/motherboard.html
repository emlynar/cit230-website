     <p>Motherboard – The motherboard of a computer is where all the pieces come together. The motherboard holds pieces like the CPU, RAM, Graphics cards, and other cards to all complete functionality. A motherboard must be new enough to have the right pin count for a CPU. It must have enough slots for all the sticks of RAM you will need for your build. It must have enough PCI slots for all your extra cards like graphics cards, physics cards, sounds cards, or even network cards. A motherboard carries all the information from one piece to the other and allows for flawless communication. It should also be properly powered by a Power Supply which you can refer to in the “Learn” section of this site. A motherboard sometimes has “onboard” pieces, such as audio jacks or a network interface. It all depends on the board. </p>
