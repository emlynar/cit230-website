        <p>Peripherals â€“ A peripheral is any extra equipment like mice and keyboards that are used with your build. Examples of peripherals are mice, keyboards, USB devices like external hard-drives, external network cards, headphones or speakers, and other devices. Usually these devices are connected USB, but may connect with headphone jacks, microphone jacks, or other connectors. Make sure when assembling your build to have enough jacks (whether USB ports or other ports) to plug in all your peripherals.</p>
