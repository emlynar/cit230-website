        <p>Speed might be the trickiest subject when it comes to buying parts for you next build. To make sure that you're not wasting money on PC parts, make sure that the speed of all your pieces work in tandem. You don't want an awesome processor and not have enough RAM to support the speed of your processor. Also, you dont' want a graphics card that is too old for you machine and your CPU has to pick up the slack. Even your RAM has speed that you should, or shouldn't, worry about. So when buying your next build, find parts that work together in harmony to produce your desired output, whether it be productivity, gaming, or whatever it may be.</p>
