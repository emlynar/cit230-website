     <p>So you want to know about Eric Mlynar? Well for starters, I'm 26 years old and currently go to school at Brigham Young University - Idaho. I am studying Computer Information Technology. I enjoy programming and working with databases. Currently, I am taking four classes. First in front-end web design, second in information security, third in Object Oriented Development 2, and lastly in Project Management. As I get farther in my studies, I realize how important it is to be methodical and have a certain approach to different sets of work in the IT field. It takes time and focus, luckily, both of which I have. But enough about me.</p>
