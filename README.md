# emlynar_website
This is my repository for my test site for test.ericmlynar.com.

I will be adding to this site as my schooling charges forward. It will be a place to showcase my skills and practice them. It might not be the prettiest site, but it will help me practice some lessons learned while in school at Brigham Young University - Idaho. The site will consist mainly of a blog about how my classes are going. Most or all of this will be done by hand in order to practice working on the bits and pieces.
