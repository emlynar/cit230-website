     <p>RAM â€“ Random Access Memory is the computer resource that stores all values of currently worked on programs. It works hand in hand with the CPU and is like the short-term memory of that processor. Without the RAM, the CPU would have no where to write the answer to all the problems that it solves. RAM is on of the easiest components to install and to buy for when it comes to a PC build. Usually, one can say they have 8 Gigabytes of RAM and the rest of the people listening can easily gauge how effective that is for the PC. Low amounts of RAM can hinder a computer significantly causing it to be quite slow. If you run intense games or like to have a thousand tabs open in your web browser, upgrading your RAM is a great place to start your investment.</p>
