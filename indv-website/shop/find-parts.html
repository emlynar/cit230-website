        <p>Finding computer parts can be difficult, but this guide will help you on your path. You can always find parts at a computer store, but in order to find the best deals, you have to start online. There are a few sites that I would recommend. They are <a href="https://www.newegg.com">NewEgg.com</a> or <a href="http://www.tigerdirect.com">TigerDirect.com</a>. These are sites that can really help you find great deals on your search for the best deals for computer parts.</p>
