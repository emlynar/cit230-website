     <p>Power Supply – A power supply is the piece of your computer that regulates the power from the wall to the rest of your build. More power doesn’t always mean that the supply is better but having enough power for all the components of your build is crucial. You also need to have a power supply with all the right connectors for each of the pieces of your build. Most of the connectors will go straight into your motherboard, but if your missing a connector, the card without power will be rendered completely useless. Power supplies will also have different qualities so be sure to check them out when purchasing a power supply.</p>
